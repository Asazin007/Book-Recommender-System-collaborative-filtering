# Book Recommender System

This project implements a Book Recommender System using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system suggests books to users based on their reading history and preferences. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## Features

- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on user-user similarities.
- Content-Based Filtering: Suggests books similar to those a user has liked.
- Hybrid Approach: Combines both collaborative and content-based methods for enhanced recommendations.
